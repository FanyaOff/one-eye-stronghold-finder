Fork of [Hopper4et Mod](https://github.com/Hopper4et/one-eye-stronghold-finder)

# Fixes

## Instructions
Just throw Eye of Ender and mod will write the coordinates of nearest stronghold in the chat.

![demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e0b2afb-9917-4131-83bc-c7aefae849a4)

Green coordinates mean that the structure is most likely located here. The accuracy that the first coordinates will be a stronghold is 95%.
